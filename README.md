# openIMIS Backend Grievance Social Protection reference module
This repository holds the files of the openIMIS Backend grievance social protection reference module.
It is dedicated to be deployed as a module of [openimis-be_py](https://github.com/openimis/openimis-be_py).

## Features

- **Grievance Management**: Create, update, and track grievances
- **Comments System**: Add comments and resolutions to grievance
- **Configurable Categories and Flags**: Define custom grievance types and flags
- **Automatic Rights Generation**: Auto-generate rights based on category/flag permissions
- **Restricted View Access**: Three-tier access levels (restricted/read/full) with automatic data filtering
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Support for multi-level category structures with permission inheritance
- **Priority Management**: Automatic priority assignment based on category/flag configuration
- **Resolution Tracking**: Configure resolution times by category

## Configuration options (can be changed via core.ModuleConfiguration)

### Basic Configuration

* `resolution_times`: time to resolution in form of CRON timedelta: {days},{hours} where days are values between <0, 99) and hours are between 0 and 24. 
(default: `5,0`)

* `default_resolution`: The field will be in form of the JSON dictionary with pairs like: 
Key - type of the grievance, 
Value - time to resolution in form of CRON timedelta: `{days},{hours}` where days are values between <0, 99) and hours are between 0 and 24.
(default: `{Default: '5,0'}`)
Note: If for given type of the grievance time is not provided then default value is used from `resolution_times`.

### Categories Configuration

The module supports both simple and enhanced category configurations:

#### Simple Format (backward compatible)
```json
{
  "grievance_types": ["complaint", "feedback", "appeal"]
}
```

#### Enhanced Format with Auto-Generated Permission IDs
```json
{
  "grievance_flags": [
    "public",
    {
      "name": "sensitive",
      "priority": "Critical",
      "permissions": ["restricted_read", "read", "create"]
    }
  ],
  "grievance_types": [
    "simple_category",
    {
      "name": "complaint",
      "priority": "High",
      "permissions": ["restricted_read", "read", "create", "update"],
      "visible_fields": ["id", "status", "category", "priority", "date_created"],
      "default_flags": ["urgent"],
      "resolution_times": "3,0",  // 3 days, 0 hours
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "vbg_complaint",
          "permissions": ["restricted_read", "read", "create"],
          "visible_fields": ["id", "status", "category"],  // More restrictive than parent
          "resolution_times": "2,12",  // Overrides parent's resolution time
          "default_flags": ["confidential"]
        },
        {
          "name": "general_complaint"
          // Inherits parent's permissions and visible_fields
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Permission ID Auto-Generation
The grievance module automatically generates permission IDs using Django's auth_permission table:

1. **ID Range Convention**:
   - Static permissions: 127000-127099 (hardcoded module permissions)
   - Dynamic permissions: 127100-127999 (auto-generated for categories/flags)

2. **Auto-Generated ID Pattern**:
   Permission IDs are automatically assigned following a suffix pattern:
   - IDs ending in `0` - read permission (for gql_query_*)
   - IDs ending in `1` - create permission (for gql_mutation_create_*)
   - IDs ending in `2` - update permission (for gql_mutation_update_*)
   - IDs ending in `3` - delete permission (for gql_mutation_delete_*)
   - IDs ending in `4` - restricted_read permission

3. **Permission Types**:
   - `"restricted_read"` - Limited view access
   - `"read"` - Full read access
   - `"create"` - Create/write access
   - `"update"` - Update/modify access
   - `"delete"` - Delete access

4. **Persistence**:
   - Permissions are stored in Django's `auth_permission` table
   - Once assigned, an ID remains stable even if configuration changes
   - Permissions can be managed through Django admin interface
   - Deleted permissions free up their IDs for reuse

3. **Access Levels** (based on user's rights):
   - **Restricted Access** (`restricted_read` right): 
     - If `visible_fields` is configured: Users see only fields listed in `visible_fields`
     - If `visible_fields` is not configured: Users see only basic info (id, status, dates, category, priority)
     - Non-visible fields show as "[Restricted]" for text fields or null for other types
     - Can only filter queries on visible fields
   - **Read Access** (`read` right): 
     - Users see all ticket information including descriptions and resolutions
     - Can filter on all fields
     - Cannot modify tickets
   - **Full Access** (`create`/`update` rights): 
     - Users can view and modify tickets
     - Can create new tickets in categories where they have `create` permission

##### Resolution Times Priority
Resolution times are determined in the following order:
1. Category-specific `resolution_times` (with inheritance from parent categories)
2. Legacy `default_resolution` configuration for the category
3. Global `resolution_times` configuration
4. Default value `5,0` (5 days, 0 hours)

##### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "resolution_times": "5,0",  // Global default: 5 days
  "default_resolution": {     // Legacy configuration (still supported)
    "feedback": "7,0"
  },
  "grievance_types": [
    {
      "name": "complaint",
      "resolution_times": "3,0",  // Category-specific: 3 days
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "urgent_complaint",
          "resolution_times": "1,0"  // Override: 1 day
        },
        {
          "name": "general_complaint"  // Inherits parent's 3 days
        }
      ]
    },
    "feedback"  // Uses default_resolution: 7 days
  ]
}

#### Visible Fields Configuration

The `visible_fields` feature controls field visibility for users with `restricted_read` permission:

```json
{
  "name": "complaint",
  "visible_fields": ["id", "status", "category", "priority", "date_created"],
  "permissions": ["restricted_read", "read", "create"]
}
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Automatic Permission Requirements**: When `visible_fields` is defined, the system automatically adds `restricted_read` and `read` permissions if not already present.

2. **Inheritance with Security Boundaries**: 
   - Child categories inherit parent's `visible_fields` by default
   - **Security Boundary**: Children can only make fields MORE restrictive, never less
   - A child cannot expose fields that the parent has hidden
   - This ensures security boundaries are maintained through the category hierarchy

3. **Field Visibility Rules**:
   - Users with `restricted_read`: See only fields in `visible_fields` list
   - Users with `read` or higher: See all fields
   - Non-visible fields return `[Restricted]` for text fields or `null` for other types

4. **Example Inheritance**:
```json
{
  "name": "complaint",
  "visible_fields": ["id", "status", "category", "priority", "date_created"],
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "vbg_complaint",
      "visible_fields": ["id", "status"]  // ✓ Valid - subset of parent
    },
    {
      "name": "fraud_complaint",
      "visible_fields": ["id", "status", "title"]  // ✗ Invalid - "title" not in parent
      // System will automatically remove "title" and log a warning
    }
  ]
}
```

5. **Default Behavior**: If `visible_fields` is not configured, restricted users see a default set of basic fields: `id`, `status`, `category`, `priority`, `date_created`.

6. **Interaction with Default Flags**: 
   - Categories cannot reduce security set by their default flags
   - If a category has `default_flags: ["confidential"]` and the confidential flag restricts certain fields, the category's `visible_fields` must respect those restrictions
   - This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information through misconfiguration

### Flags Configuration

Similarly, flags support both simple and enhanced formats:

#### Simple Format
```json
{
  "grievance_flags": ["urgent", "sensitive"]
}
```

#### Enhanced Format with Permissions
```json
{
  "grievance_flags": [
    "public",
    {
      "name": "sensitive",
      "priority": "Critical",
      "permissions": ["read", "create"]  // Auto-generates permission IDs
    }
  ]
}
```

## Permissions

### Query Permissions
- `127000`: View grievances
- `127001`: Create grievances
- `127002`: Update grievances
- `127003`: Delete grievances
- `127004`: View comments
- `127005`: Create comments
- `127006`: Resolve grievances

### Category and Flag Permissions
- Child categories inherit parent permissions unless explicitly overridden
- Grievances queries are automatically filtered based on user permissions

## GraphQL API

### Configuration Query Fields
The `grievance_config` query returns:
- `grievance_types`: Flat list of accessible categories
- `grievance_flags`: List of accessible flags
- `grievance_channels`: Available channels
- `grievance_categories_hierarchical`: Hierarchical category structure
- `grievance_flags_detailed`: Detailed flag information with permissions
- `accessible_categories`: Categories user can create grievances in
- `accessible_flags`: Flags user can apply to grievances

## Access Control Features

1. **Two-Tier Permission System**:
   - **Tier 1**: General ticket permissions (required for ALL ticket operations)
     - 127000: Query tickets
     - 127001: Create tickets
     - 127002: Update tickets
     - 127003: Delete tickets
   - **Tier 2**: Category/flag-specific permissions (additional requirements for restricted categories)

2. **Role Composition Pattern**:
   The system supports hierarchical role composition for clean permission management:
   ```
   GRIEVANCE_VIEWER (Base role)
   ├── General ticket query permissions
   └── Access to unrestricted categories
   
   COMPLAINT_VIEWER (Category role) 
   ├── Requires: GRIEVANCE_VIEWER
   └── Complaint category view permissions
   
   GBV_SPECIALIST (Specialized role)
   ├── Requires: GRIEVANCE_VIEWER + COMPLAINT_VIEWER
   └── VBG-specific permissions
   ```
   
   Users are assigned multiple roles to compose their complete permission set.

3. **Category-Based Filtering**: Users only see grievances in categories they have permission to view

4. **Flag-Based Filtering**: Grievances with restricted flags are hidden from unauthorized users

5. **Hierarchical Permissions**: 
   - Children inherit parent permissions by default
   - Children can override with more restrictive permissions
   - Users see only accessible parts of the hierarchy

6. **Create/Update Validation**: System validates permissions before allowing grievance operations

7. **Mixed Flag Handling**: When a grievance has multiple flags:
   - Flags without restrictions are ignored in access calculations
   - Access level is determined by the most restrictive flag that has permissions defined

## Security Implementation

Fine-grained security is enforced at the Django model level by overriding the `get_queryset` method. This ensures that security applies consistently across all endpoint technologies (GraphQL, FHIR, REST, etc.).

### Model-Level Security

Security filtering is implemented in the models themselves:

```python
# grievance_social_protection/models.py

class Ticket(HistoryBusinessModel):
    @classmethod
    def get_queryset(cls, queryset, user):
        queryset = cls.filter_queryset(queryset)
        # GraphQL calls with an info object while Rest calls with the user itself
        if isinstance(user, ResolveInfo):
            user = user.context.user
        if settings.ROW_SECURITY and user.is_anonymous:
            return queryset.filter(id=None)
        if settings.ROW_SECURITY:
            # Apply category and flag permission filtering
            from .access_control import GrievanceAccessControl
            queryset = GrievanceAccessControl.filter_ticket_queryset(queryset, user)
        return queryset
```

### Field-Level Access Control

While queryset filtering happens at the model level, field-level access control (showing "[Restricted]" for sensitive fields) is implemented in the GraphQL type resolvers to provide granular control over field visibility based on the user's access level

## Permission Management

### Auto-Generated Permissions

The module uses Django's `auth_permission` table to store and manage permissions:

1. **Automatic Creation**: On module startup, permissions are automatically created in the `auth_permission` table based on your configuration
2. **Stable IDs**: Once created, permission IDs remain stable even if configuration changes
3. **Django Admin Management**: Permissions can be viewed and managed through Django's admin interface
4. **ID Reuse**: Deleted permissions free up their IDs for potential reuse following the suffix pattern

### Permission Lifecycle

1. **Creation**:
   - Configure categories/flags with permission requirements in ModuleConfiguration
   - On startup, system checks if permissions exist in `auth_permission`
   - New permissions are created with auto-generated IDs following the suffix pattern
   - Existing permissions retain their IDs

2. **Updates**:
   - Configuration changes don't affect existing permission IDs
   - New permissions in configuration create new entries
   - Removed permissions from configuration remain in `auth_permission` until manually deleted

3. **Deletion**:
   - Permissions must be explicitly deleted through Django admin
   - Deleting a permission frees its ID for reuse
   - Roles referencing deleted permissions lose that access

### Managing Permissions

Use the provided management command to view and manage permissions:

```bash
# List all grievance permissions
python manage.py manage_grievance_permissions list

# Export permission mapping for backup
python manage.py manage_grievance_permissions export --format=json > permissions_backup.json

# Find and remove orphaned permissions
python manage.py manage_grievance_permissions cleanup --dry-run
python manage.py manage_grievance_permissions cleanup

# Sync permissions with current configuration
python manage.py manage_grievance_permissions sync
```
